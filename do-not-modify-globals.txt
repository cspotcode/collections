Fork collections, make it not modify any built-in prototypes.
iterator.js:345
  shimming StopIteration by modifying Object.prototype.toString?
  not allowed!!
array-changes.js:30
  making arrays observable
  one trick uses __proto__ substitution
  the other is...
  Should I use a similar trick in the implementation of ShimArray?
  
  defineProperty(Array.prototype, 

Object.create
  Can I use this?  Should I use a polyfill?
Object.freeze
  Can I use this?  Do we require a browser that implements freeze?

Copy static Array methods onto ShimArray
Copy static Object methods onto ShimObject

Implement ShimArray.prototype.concat()
  - mimic native concat() behavior
  - return a ShimArray, not an Array

Whenever you are:
  - Invoking a method on a collection
  - the collection might be an Array
  - the method is added by collections.js
You must check if the method is not on the object, then do a `ShimArray.prototype.method.(apply|call)`
